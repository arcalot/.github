# Arcalot

The Arcalot community develops tools, plugins, and libraries that you can use either standalone as a library, and/or via a user interface or CLI. You can run the tools locally, remotely, or as part of a bigger system. Arcalot:

* Helps you create workflows with **normalized input and output schemas**
* Provides you with **assisted and automated root cause analysis** for the workflows you create as well as CI and other log systems
* Provides **stable plugins for several workloads**
