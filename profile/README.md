The Arcalot community is dedicated to developing modular tools, plugins, and libraries
with flexible implementations independently or as complete end-to-end solutions. We
believe in enabling the automation and portability of complex tasks and in
pre-validating actions to avoid costly re-runs due to late failures and incompatible
data.

Arcaflow is a workflow system consisting of three main components:

* A core engine, statically-compiled and platform-portable, written in Go
* Plugins, written in various languages and delivered as Linux containers or modules
* Workflow definitions, written in YAML, tieing together plugins and their data

It allows you create workflows with parallel and serial tasks, passing data between the
tasks to achieve simple or complex pipelines of actions that result in machine-readable
outputs. The community supports an ever-growing variety of plugins, and we provide SDKs
in Go and Python to aid the user in developing their own custom plugins.

Arcaflow allows you to encapsulate and version-control expertise, making potentially
very complex workflows easily portable among environments and automation systems. With
an Arcaflow workflow, you can carefully craft a pipeline of actions that serves your
direct needs, and share that worflow virtually unchanged for others to run in different
environments and CI/CD systems.

Arcalog can assist you with or automate your root cause analysis in CI or other log systems either as a standalone tool or by embedding it into your applications.

It also provides additional tooling to download jobs from various log systems or add your own log files for analysis.
